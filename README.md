This application is written in C# is meant to display the use of a model-view-controller architecture pattern. We display this in the following:

Model - The chasey for the data (student and professor objects) and method calls to access this data
View - Traditionally, we would use some sort of user interface on the front-end but in this case, we use the console
Controller - The intermediary between the view and the model

The application works as follows:

The user will enter the first name, last name, and contact email of the instructor.
The user will enter the first name, last name, and class rank of one or more students.
The user will be able to see the roster arranged in the order entered.
The user will be allowed to repeat the process of adding another student and seeing the roster.
